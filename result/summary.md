# Projects in Data Science (2025)

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing images of human skin with visible lesions. The primary objective is to determine whether these skin lesions may indicate the presence of cancer or if they result from genetic factors, injury, or other conditions.

We begin by defining skin lesions as areas of the skin that differ in appearance from the surrounding tissue. Skin lesions are common and can arise due to various causes, including injury, genetic predisposition, infections, or autoimmune diseases. In some cases, they may also serve as early indicators of serious conditions, such as skin cancer.

As part of our analysis, we quantify the number of hairs present in each image from the dataset. Additionally, we preprocess the images by removing hair to enhance the clarity of the lesions. This step enables more effective identification and classification of skin lesions, facilitating the distinction between those associated with potential diseases and those caused by genetic or external factors.
